# AWS-SERVERLESS WEBSITES 

Project Description: This project involved building a serverless website using AWS services. The website allows users to input data, which is stored in an Amazon DynamoDB database through a RESTful API built with AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions. The backend logic is fully serverless, enabling data storage and retrieval operations efficiently without managing any servers. Users can view and retrieve the stored data through the same API, ensuring a seamless and scalable user experience.

Reasons for Choosing Serverless Architecture:

Scalability: Serverless solutions like AWS Lambda automatically scale to handle varying amounts of traffic, ensuring consistent performance during high user loads.


Cost-effectiveness: Serverless computing follows a pay-as-you-go model, so you only pay for the compute time you use, reducing overall costs for smaller or sporadically used applications.

Reduced Maintenance: Serverless platforms eliminate the need for server management, including patching, scaling, and uptime monitoring, allowing developers to focus on code and application logic.

Faster Development: With serverless architecture, developers can quickly deploy and iterate on application features without worrying about infrastructure complexities.

High Availability: AWS services like Lambda and DynamoDB are designed with built-in fault tolerance and high availability, which improves the reliability of the application.

## Amazon services use

S3, API GATEWAY(REACT), LAMBDA, DYNAMO DB.
